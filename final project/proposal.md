Here is a suggested outline for your proposal. You don't need to follow this
outline, but it may help you focus your project.

* Project title
    SeekFreek (Working Title)
* Team members
    Benjamin Josie
* Description (1 pp describing the basic idea)
    Step sequencer capable of sequencing MIDI, as well as live samples. Must be able to read MIDI data (easy using the MIDI library) and send MIDI notes (which shouldn't be hard to extend on the library). The difficult part will come from using an ADC to store a sample in a meaningful form (only keeping the parts of the signal we'll want to send). Hopefully, the DAC on the Pi will be usable and streamlined. The physical interface will be laser-cut acrylic with and led-enhanced button for each step. There will be a couple more buttons and switches, as well as one potentiometer for tempo control.

* Hardware required (itemize what hardware, if any, you need)
    12+ LED Arcade Buttons
    1 10k Potentiometer
    1 ADC (ADS 1115 16-Bit ADC)
        (Link Here: https://www.adafruit.com/product/1085?gclid=EAIaIQobChMInvvLiN_83gIVox-tBh0pHgNfEAQYASABEgIOtPD_BwE)
    2 MIDI Jacks
    1 Dual Female Analog Jac


* Funds requested (the amount you will want to be reimbursed, remember you have
  a $20 budget per person)
  $20. I will probs have to spend more, but I'm pretty excited for this project anyway.

* Major task breakdown and who is responsible for each task
  Me
* Goals for next week
    Finish up the MIDI library. Begin the process of working with analog signals. The interface design itself will be time-consuming but relatively straightforward. These are the aspects that can be trickiest. The analog signal stuff.

* References and resources used

Keep the proposal short and to the point.

We suggest you try to get all the major hardware components working by the
first week. That will leave the following week for putting the components
together into a working system.
